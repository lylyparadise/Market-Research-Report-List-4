<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glasses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic Coating</li><li>Hydrophilic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning glasses come in two different types of coatings: hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic coatings repel water and other liquids, preventing them from sticking to the surface of the glass. On the other hand, hydrophilic coatings attract water and help it spread out evenly, making it easier to wash away dirt and debris. Both types of coatings help to keep the glass clean and clear, reducing the need for frequent cleaning and maintenance.</p></p>

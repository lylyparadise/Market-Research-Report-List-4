<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Sonar Data Recording System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar Type</li><li>Active Sonar Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Submarine Sonar Data Recording System market includes two main types: Passive Sonar Type and Active Sonar Type. Passive Sonar Type systems simply listen for acoustic signals in the water without emitting any signals themselves, making them harder to detect. Active Sonar Type systems emit sound pulses and analyze the echoes that bounce back from objects in the water, allowing for better detection and tracking of underwater objects. Both types play a crucial role in underwater navigation, communication, and defense systems.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tissue Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stented Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Stentless Tissue Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tissue heart valves are prosthetic devices used to replace damaged or diseased heart valves. There are two main types of tissue heart valves: stented and stentless. Stented tissue heart valves are composed of a metal or plastic stent that provides support and structure to the valve. Stentless tissue heart valves do not have a stent and rely on the native anatomy of the heart for support. Both types of tissue heart valves are commonly used in heart valve replacement surgeries, with each offering unique benefits and considerations.</p></p>

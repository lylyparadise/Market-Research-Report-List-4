<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welded Steel Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Drawing Processing Technique</li><li>Hot Rolling Processing Technique</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cold drawing processing technique in the welded steel pipe market involves pulling the steel tube through a die to reduce its diameter and wall thickness. This process enables tighter dimensional tolerances and a smoother surface finish. On the other hand, hot rolling processing technique involves heating the steel billet to high temperatures and passing it through rollers to form the desired shape. Hot rolling results in a more cost-effective production process but may have looser dimensional tolerances compared to cold drawing.</p></p>

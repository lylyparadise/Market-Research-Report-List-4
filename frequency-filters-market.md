<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Frequency Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Frequency Filters</li><li>Active Frequency Filters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Frequency filters are devices used to allow certain frequencies to pass through while attenuating others. Passive frequency filters consist of passive components such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors. These filters do not require an external power source and are commonly used in applications where power consumption is a concern. Active frequency filters, on the other hand, use active components such as transistors and op-amps to achieve filtering. They require an external power source and are typically used in applications where more precise control over the filtering characteristics is needed.</p></p>

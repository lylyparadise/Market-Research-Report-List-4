<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Luffing Stackers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slewing</li><li>Non Slewing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Luffing stackers are commonly used in material handling applications. There are two main market types for these stackers: slewing and non-slewing. Slewing stackers are equipped with a rotating mechanism that allows the boom to move side to side, offering greater flexibility in positioning loads. Non-slewing stackers, on the other hand, have a fixed boom and are ideal for applications where precise and stable stacking is required. Both types of stackers offer unique benefits depending on the specific needs of the operation.</p></p>

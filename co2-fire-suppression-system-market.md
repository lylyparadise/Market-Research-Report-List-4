<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Fire Suppression System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure CO2 Systems</li><li>Low Pressure CO2 Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CO2 fire suppression systems are categorized into two types based on pressure levels: high pressure CO2 systems and low pressure CO2 systems. High pressure systems use compressed CO2 stored in cylinders, which is released through nozzles to extinguish fires quickly. On the other hand, low pressure systems utilize a tank of liquid CO2, which is expanded into gas form upon release into the protected area. Both systems are effective in suppressing fires by displacing oxygen and cooling the affected area rapidly.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nut Roaster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-Air Type</li><li>Direct-Fire Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nut roasters can be classified into two main types based on their heating mechanisms: hot-air type and direct-fire type. Hot-air type nut roasters use hot air to roast nuts, providing a more even and gentle roasting process that helps maintain the natural flavors of the nuts. On the other hand, direct-fire type nut roasters use direct flames to roast nuts, leading to a quicker and more intense roasting process that can result in a smokier flavor profile. Both types cater to different preferences in nut roasting methods.</p></p>

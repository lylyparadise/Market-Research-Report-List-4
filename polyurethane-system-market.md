<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Type</li><li>Thermosetting Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane systems can be classified into two main types: thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic polyurethane systems are materials that can be melted and reshaped multiple times when heated. They have excellent flexibility and durability, making them ideal for applications such as films, fibers, and coatings. On the other hand, thermosetting polyurethane systems undergo a chemical reaction during curing, forming a permanent crosslinked structure. This results in materials with superior strength, stiffness, and heat resistance, commonly used in industries such as automotive, construction, and electronics.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Cannula Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Femoral cannulas are medical devices used in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures. There are two main types of femoral cannulas: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar femoral cannulas have a single lumen for delivering blood to the patient while draining it back to the bypass machine. In contrast, bipolar femoral cannulas have two lumens, allowing for separate delivery and drainage of blood. Each type of femoral cannula has its own advantages and is used based on the specific needs of the patient and the procedure being performed.</p></p>

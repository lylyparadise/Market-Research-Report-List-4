<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural fans are categorized into two main types - centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans are designed to move air in a curved path while creating a high-pressure airflow. They are ideal for applications requiring ventilation, drying, and cooling. On the other hand, axial fans move air parallel to the fan's shaft, creating a powerful airflow suitable for large ventilation systems. Both types of fans play a crucial role in agriculture by providing proper air circulation and temperature control in livestock barns, greenhouses, and other agricultural facilities.</p></p>

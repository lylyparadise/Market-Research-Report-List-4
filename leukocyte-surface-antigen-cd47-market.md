<p><h1>Leukocyte Surface Antigen CD47 Market Size Focuses on Market Dynamics, In-Depth Analysis and Future Projections of its Market Forecasted for Period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Leukocyte Surface Antigen CD47 Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Leukocyte Surface Antigen CD47, also known as integrin-associated protein, is a cell surface protein that plays a crucial role in immune response regulation. CD47 is primarily expressed on red blood cells, platelets, and various immune cells like T cells, B cells, and macrophages. It acts as a marker of self-recognition, preventing phagocytosis of healthy cells by binding to the signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on macrophages.</p><p>The Leukocyte Surface Antigen CD47 Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% during the forecast period. The increasing research and development activities in the field of immunotherapy and cancer treatment are driving the growth of the CD47 market. CD47 has gained significant attention in recent years as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, as blocking CD47-SIRPα interactions can enhance anti-tumor immunity and promote phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages.</p><p>Moreover, the growing prevalence of cancer and autoimmune diseases, along with the rising investments in drug development, are further fueling the market growth. The latest trends in the Leukocyte Surface Antigen CD47 Market include the development of novel CD47-targeting therapies, combination strategies with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, and ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of CD47 inhibitors in various cancer types.</p></p>

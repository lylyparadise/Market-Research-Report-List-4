<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cereal Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross-flow</li><li>Down-stream</li><li>Mixed-flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cereal dryers are commonly classified into three main types based on the direction of airflow within the dryer: cross-flow, down-stream, and mixed-flow. In cross-flow dryers, the hot air flows perpendicular to the direction of the product movement, ensuring efficient and uniform drying. Down-stream dryers have the air flow in the same direction as the product movement, allowing for easier control of temperature and humidity levels. Mixed-flow dryers combine aspects of both cross-flow and down-stream designs, providing a balance of efficiency and control.</p></p>

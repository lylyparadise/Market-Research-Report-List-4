<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent-free Polyurethane Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocomponent</li><li>Bi-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solvent-free polyurethane adhesive is available in two main market types: monocomponent and bi-component. Monocomponent adhesives consist of a single-component formula that is ready to use without the need for any mixing. On the other hand, bi-component adhesives require two separate components to be mixed together before application. While monocomponent adhesives offer convenience and ease of use, bi-component adhesives often provide stronger bonding capabilities and greater versatility for a wider range of applications. Both types of adhesives offer environmentally friendly options without the use of solvents.</p></p>

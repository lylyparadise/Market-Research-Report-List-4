<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mesh Fixation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Fixation Device</li><li>Non-Absorbable Fixation Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mesh fixation devices are used in surgical procedures to secure mesh implants in place. There are two main types of mesh fixation devices: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable fixation devices are made of materials that are gradually broken down and absorbed by the body over time. Non-absorbable fixation devices, on the other hand, are made of materials that remain in the body permanently. Each type has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical procedure.</p></p>

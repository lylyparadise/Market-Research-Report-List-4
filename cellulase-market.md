<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EG</li><li>CBH</li><li>BG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cellulase enzymes are categorized into three main types based on their mode of action: Endoglucanase (EG), which breaks down cellulose into smaller sugar molecules by randomly attacking internal bonds; Cellobiohydrolase (CBH), which works from the ends of the cellulose chains to release cellobiose units; and Beta-glucosidase (BG), which further breaks down cellobiose into glucose. Each type of cellulase plays a unique role in the overall process of cellulose degradation, making them essential components in industries such as biofuel production and textile manufacturing.</p></p>
